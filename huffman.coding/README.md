# Huffman Coding

## Disclaimer

This implementation of the Huffman Coding algorithm is very simple and inefficient. It is mainly for educational purposes and it's not intended to be usable in real life scenarios.

## Run

The program takes whatever is in the file *input.txt* and compresses it and decompresses it to respectively *compressed.b* and *decompressed.b*.

In order to compile and run the program issue the following commands (**TESTED ONLY ON A LINUX MACHINE**):

```
make
```

```
./huffman.out
```

If you want to run valgrind just run:

```
make debug
```
